👋 Hey, I’m Radu Comsa

This is my playground for gathering (no-bullshit / PRO) information and templates for my projects.
I’m currently learning everything I can find about Swift and SwiftUI because I’m interested in IOS mobile app development as a hobby.

🛑 DISCLAIMER: 

I code as I write <<< I write as I speak <<< I speak as I think <<< I have a stoic perspective of the world and sometimes I use strong language 🤬 

🧘‍♂️ MANTRAS - Reminders to myself:
- Beginner is totally fine but doesn’t get the job done, do more - become better!
- Easy & Clean is the hardest to achieve
- Other people are searching for solutions, so don’t f@%k around posting ”hello world” stuff on GitHub

You can borrow some of my mantras or all of them. Thank me later 🍻
